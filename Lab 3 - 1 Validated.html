<p>It is time for our annual recycling drive! Recycling means taking a product or material at
the end of its useful life and making it a usable raw material to make another product. We have
been very successful with paper and plastic products. Last year, we recycled more items than
our previous three years. Let's try to do it again this year. We will have a dinner for
everyone involved with the recycle drive on Saturday night. We hope to see you all there!</p>
